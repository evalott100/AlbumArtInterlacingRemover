# AlbumArtInterlacingRemover
* My rockbox ipod 5g doesn't support album art with interlacing so I use this to convert all album art to jpg without interlacing.
* My client kept crashing on transfer so I wrote a little utility to copy songs over.

I'll probably eventually tie these together nicely so it's one utility and I don't have to convert album art on my local machine.
